# C++
Hi everyone,
The  hr-min-sec.cpp is my first program in C++ language
This code will convert a large number of seconds into hours, mintues, and seconds.
First step is declare variable, the set up code in order let user input their values.
The third step is calculation, converting number into hours,minutes,seconds.
The last step is output the results.
Thank you, 
Jia
