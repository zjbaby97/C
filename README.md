# C++
Hi everyone,
The  hr-min-sec.cpp is my first program in C++ language
This code will convert a large number of seconds into hours, mintues, and seconds.
First step is declare variable, the set up code in order let user input their values.
The third step is calculation, converting number into hours,minutes,seconds.
The last step is output the results.
Thank you, 
Jia

ItemShippingCalculator.cpp is a program that contains the following:
Prompt and retrieve the following input from the user (through the console):
Item name
Is the item fragile (add in $2.00 if the item is fragile)
The order total (without shipping)
The destination to which the item will be shipped (USA, Canada, Australia, even Mars!!)  
It contains I/O manipulator and if else statement and muti relational operators in order to get the final effect.
All the explaination comment are resided cpp file next to the code.
